-Where does the Sun's name cames from?

The term "sun" in English originated from the Old English word "sunne." 
Similar terms are found in various Germanic languages, such as West Frisian "sinne," Dutch "zon," Low German "Sünn," Standard German "Sonne," Bavarian "Sunna," Old Norse "sunna," and Gothic "sunnō," all tracing their roots back to Proto-Germanic *sunnōn. 
This etymological connection extends to the word for "sun" in other Indo-European language branches, where a nominative stem with an 'l' is more common than the genitive stem with 'n.' 
Examples include Latin "sōl," ancient Greek "ἥλιος" (hēlios), Welsh "haul," Czech "slunce," Sanskrit "स्वर" (svár), and Persian "خور" (xvar). 
The Proto-Germanic l-stem also persisted as *sōwelan, giving rise to Gothic "sauil" (in addition to "sunnō") and Old Norse "sól" (in addition to the poetic "sunna"), influencing the terms for "sun" in modern Scandinavian languages like Swedish, Danish, and Icelandic.
