# PLANETARIUM
Explore and discover the beauty of our solar system!

## Behind Planetarium
Planetarium is an idea borned during the development of another project, MathMind, as the next project to work on.
I took it as an excuse to learn more and get better at coding and using all sorts of tools, like git.

## Planetarium Project
Have the entire solar system in your hands, click on planets, stars and onbjects to discover and learn their stories and cool facts.
All of this in a minimalistic map with actually moving planets!!
Isn't this fantastic?

## What's new (03/01/2024)
As of today, I am working on the creation of the page dedicated to the Sun, I am gathering informations and i will soon start to upload them on said page.
This will take time as I don't want it look as a copy-paste from Wikipedia or the x source I am getting my informations.

I will soon start working on icons
