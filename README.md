# PLANETARIUM
Explore and discover the beauty of our solar system!

##Behind Planetarium
Planetarium is an idea borned during the development of another project, MathMind, as the next project to work on.
I took it as an excuse to learn more and get better at coding and using all sorts of tools, like git.

##Planetarium Project
Have the entire solar system in your hands, click on planets, stars and onbjects to discover and learn their stories and cool facts.
All of this in a minimalistic map with actually moving planets!!
Isn't this fantastic?
